# Daily Coding Challenge

A collection of problems meant for daily coding exercises.
The _current_ goal is one year of daily coding, i.e. 365 small programs.

An (optimal) problem results in a self-contained program, algorithm or data
structure, which can be implemented within approximately one hour.
Alternatively, series of sub-problems yield logically and structurally
independent solutions to a more complex problem.
It may then be solved by combining the previous solutions.

**Note**: Algorithms and data structures should be implemented generically,
i.e. they should be able to handle data of any size and type, unless explicitly
stated otherwise (e.g. LSD radix sort, which makes use of integer types).
